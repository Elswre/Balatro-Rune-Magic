# Balatro-Rune-Magic

Rune Magic is a Norse mythology inspired mod for Balatro that focuses on a new type of consumable called Rune Cards. Rune Cards are based on the Elder Futhark with each card having a powerful but temperamental effect. The Runes in norse mythology are a powerful tool for many, but they are also incredibly dificult to use without secret knowledge. To simulate this, each Rune Card will have a part of its effect that is at least partially out of the player's control.
